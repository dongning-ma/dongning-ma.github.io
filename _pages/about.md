I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), working with [Prof. Abdulrahman Mahmoud](https://ma3mool.github.io/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [Villanova University](https://villanova.edu/) in 2025 under the supervision of [Prof. Xun Jiao](https://vu-detail.github.io/people/jiao). I obtained my B.Eng. degree from [University of Science and Technology Beijing](https://www.ustb.edu.cn/) in 2018 under the supervision of Dr. Jiyuan Dong. 

I am actively looking for research positions in industry or tenure-track positions in academia. I have published more than 30 papers in venues including ASPLOS, DAC, SIGIR, and TCAD, with best paper nominations from DATE, ISSRE, Euromicro DSD and SELSE. My research focuses are:
- Hardware/Software Co-design for Efficient and Reliable Machine Learning Systems
- Emerging Computing Schemes such as Approximate Computing and Bio-inspired Computing 
- Computer Architecture for AI/ML Enabled Brain Computer Interface
