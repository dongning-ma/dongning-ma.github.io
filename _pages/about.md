I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), working with [Prof. Abdulrahman Mahmoud](https://ma3mool.github.io/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [Villanova University](https://villanova.edu/) in 2025 under the supervision of [Prof. Xun Jiao](https://vu-detail.github.io/people/jiao). I obtained my B.Eng. degree from [University of Science and Technology Beijing](https://www.ustb.edu.cn/) in 2018 under the supervision of Dr. Jiyuan Dong. 

I am actively looking for research positions in industry or tenure-track positions in academia. I have published more than 30 papers in venues including ASPLOS, DAC, SIGIR, and TCAD, with best paper awards and nominations from DATE, ISSRE, Euromicro DSD and SELSE. My research focuses are:
- Hardware/Software Co-design for Efficient and Reliable Machine Learning Systems
- Emerging Computing Schemes such as Approximate Computing and Bio-inspired Computing 
- Computer Architecture for AI/ML Enabled Brain Computer Interface
