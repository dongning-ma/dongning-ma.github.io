I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), working with [Prof. Abdulrahman Mahmoud](https://ma3mool.github.io/) and [Prof. Chun Jason Xue](https://mlab.hk/people/jasonxue/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [Villanova University](https://villanova.edu/) in 2025 under the supervision of [Prof. Xun Jiao](https://vu-detail.github.io/people/jiao). I obtained my B.Eng. degree from [University of Science and Technology Beijing](https://www.ustb.edu.cn/) in 2018 under the supervision of Dr. Jiyuan Dong. 

I am actively looking for research positions in industry or tenure-track positions in academia. I have published more than 30 papers in venues including ASPLOS, DAC, SIGIR, and TCAD, with 3 best paper nominations. My main research directions are:
1. Joint optimization of reliability, efficiency and performance of deep learning systems.
2. Biomedical / Bioinfomatics with AI/ML.
3. Emerging computing schemes such as approximate computing and bio-inspired computing.
